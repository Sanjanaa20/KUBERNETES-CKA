# KUBERNETES-CKA
Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.  This Kubernetes certification course helps you gain the knowledge required to design and deploy cloud native applications on a Kubernetes cluster. 

## Purpose
- To host your application in the form of containers in an automated fashion.
- We can easily deploy as many instaces of your application as required ans easily enable communication.

### Node
The master node in the Kubernetes cluster the master node is responsible for managing the Kubernetes.
Master-> Manage,Plan,Schedule,Monitor nodes
Control Node-> Host application as containers

## Real life example
1. We will look at each of these components and now there arr many containers being loaded and unloaded from the ships daily.
2. As you need to maintain information about different ships what container is on which ship and what time it was loaded etc
3. All of these are stored in a highly available key value store known as ###ETCD
